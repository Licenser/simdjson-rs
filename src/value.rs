/// This module holds the two dom implementations we use. We distingush between
/// owned and borrowed. The difference being is that the borrowed value will
/// use `&str` as its string type, refferencing the input, while owned will
/// allocate a new String for each value.
///
/// Note that since json strings allow for for escape sequences the borrowed
/// value does not impement zero copy parsing, it does however not allocate
/// new memory for strings.
/// 
/// This differs notably from serds zero copy implementation as, unlike serde,
/// we do not require prior knowledge sbout string comtent to to take advantage
/// of it.
